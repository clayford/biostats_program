That's a lot for 2 hours!

## R Markdown Notebook reminders

This is an R Markdown Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. This file was created in RStudio by going to File...New File...R Notebook.

Execute code chunks by clicking the green *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing  *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (Win/Linux) or *Cmd+Shift+Return* (Mac). 

You can also press *Ctrl+Enter* (Win/Linux) or *Cmd+Return* (Mac) to run one line of code at a time (instead of the entire chunk).

Add a new R code chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Win/Linux) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).  

## Load data and packages

Let's load the tidyverse package:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Today we'll continue working with the following data:

Jung, Su-Young J et al. (2019), Data from: Phosphate is a potential biomarker of disease severity and predicts adverse outcomes in acute kidney injury patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6v0j9

We can load the data directly from a URL. This is useful if you keep your on a version control service such as GitHub. Below we read in the `rds` version of our data, which is the native R format for storing an object. To di this we use the `readRDS` function. And since we're reading from a URL, we need to use the `url` function to open a connection to the web site. 

```{r}
link <- "https://github.com/clayford/biostats_program/raw/main/crrt.rds"
d <- readRDS(url(link))
```

The study endpoint was _death that occurred within 28 and 90 days of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) initiation_. CRRT is used to provide renal support for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). The authors were interested in whether or not patients died within 28 or 90 days, and if so, how long did they survive with CRRT. This is contained in the `Death_28D`, `Death_90B`, `time_to_death_28D`, and `time_to_death_90D` variables. They were also interested in how phosphate levels affected whether or not someone died. This is contained in the `P_0h` and `P_24h` variables. A normal phosphate level is 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL

`summary` and `hist` are fantastic for quick glances at your data.

```{r}
# call summary and hist on Death_90D, time_to_death_90D, and P_0h

```

## Hypothesis testing

Hypothesis testing is usually used to assess if two statistical measures are likely different, or if some statistic is likely different from 0. When comparing, say, the means between two groups, it's usually stated like so:

- Null: no difference in group means
- Alternative: groups means are different

This is called a _two-sided_ test since our alternative does not specify which group mean is less than or more than the other. 

Example: Compare proportion of 90 day survivors and non-survivors with myocardial infarction (heart attack). Reminder: Insert pipe operator `%>%` with *Ctrl+Shift+M* (Win/Linux) or *Cmd+Shift+M* (Mac)


```{r}
xtabs(~ Death_90D + MI, data = d) %>% 
  proportions(margin = 1) %>%   # proportions along the rows
  round(2) 
```

About 11% of survivors experienced MI versus 9% of non-survivors. What is the probability we observe a difference as big or bigger than 0.02 if there really is no difference in the entire population?

The answer is a _p-value_. We get the p-value using a hypothesis test. In this case we want to use a 2-sample proportion test with a two-sided alternative.

## 2-sample proportion test in R

We use `prop.test` function. It requires the number of "successes" (ie, event of interest) and the number of "trials" (ie, total number in each group).

Let's use `xtabs` and `addmargins` to get counts and row totals:

```{r}
xtabs(~ Death_90D + MI, data = d) %>% 
  addmargins()
```

Now we can use those values with `prop.test`:

```{r}
prop.test(x = c(76, 36), n = c(821, 323))
```


The p-value is about 0.39. If the proportion of survivors and non-survivors with MI truly was equal, this sample result is not unexpected. There's about a 39% chance of getting two proportions more different than this if there truly was no difference in the proportions.

We could say, "with the current sample size the data were unable to overcome the supposition of no difference in the proportions." 

The 95% confidence interval on the difference of the two proportions is (-0.06, 0.02). We're not sure of the magnitude or direction of the difference.

More about confidence intervals shortly.

## Chi-square test

Another way to compare two categorical variables is with a chi-square test of association. From the previous example, the null hypothesis is _no association between survivor status and MI_. Notice the p-value is identical to what we got with `prop.test`. In fact the math is exactly the same. 

```{r}
xtabs(~ Death_90D + MI, data = d) %>% 
  chisq.test()
```

The result of the `prop.test` function is more informative about how the categorical variables may differ. 

## Comparing our results with Table 1

Medical research will often present characteristics of data in _Table 1_, the first table in the paper. 

The p-value reported for the comparison of proportions for 90-day survivors and non-survivors with MI in Table 1 is 0.20. Why is that? Apparently their hypothesis was as follows:

- Null: no difference in proportions, or non-survivors greater than survivors
- Alternative: non-survivors less than survivors

To reproduce their result we specify `alternative = "less"`

```{r}
prop.test(x = c(76, 36), n = c(821, 323), alternative = "less")
```

This test is making a stronger alternative assumption that the proportion of non-survivors with MI is _less than_ the proportion of survivors with MI.

Editorial: The article does not explain why they used this alternative. I'm surprised they used it. Usually Table 1 comparisons use the more conservative two-sided alternative. It is important to note that you _DO NOT_ pick the alternative based on the observed proportions!

## Let's code: 2-sample proportion test

Compare proportion of 90 day survivors and non-survivors with hypertension (`HTN`).

```{r}

```



## More hypothesis tests

Base R has a number of hypothesis test functions. Here are a few:

- `prop.test`: compare two proportions
- `chisq.test`: association between categorical variables
- `t.test`: compare two means
- `oneway.test`: compare more than two means
- `cor.test`: linear association between numeric variables
- `wilcox.test`: compare ranks between two groups
- `kruskal.test`: compare ranks between more than two groups

Much could be said about the theory and assumptions of these tests. We don't have time to do that. Besides most research questions require more sophisticated statistical approaches that allow us to incorporate multiple variables or predictors. 

However here's one more example.

## Correlation test

From the article: "Phosphate level significantly correlated with the APACHE II (P < 0.001) and SOFA (P < 0.001) scores."

APACHE II and SOFA scores are measures of disease severity.

- Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) 
- Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 

Correlation summarizes the strength and direction of a linear relationship and ranges from -1 to 1. This image from Wikipedia does a nice job of describing what correlation measures.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#/media/File:Correlation_examples2.svg

![](Correlation_examples2.svg.png)

A correlation test tests the null hypothesis that the correlation is different from 0.

Here's the correlation between phosphate level and the APACHE II score:

```{r}
cor.test(~ P_0h + APA_II_CRRT_0h, data = d)
```

The paper simply reports the p-value of this test is less than 0.001. 

Editorial: I think it would have been more instructive to report the estimated correlation and confidence interval: 0.18 [0.12, 0.24]. A scatterplot makes this "significant" correlation appear much less significant.

```{r}
ggplot(d) +
  aes(x = P_0h, y = APA_II_CRRT_0h) +
  geom_point() 
```


## Let's code: correlation test

Let's reproduce the correlation between phosphate level and the SOFA score:

```{r}

```


## Complaints about hypothesis testing

- implausible null hypotheses
- encourages researchers to engage in dichotomous thinking and downplay
  uncertainty and nuance
- misinterpretation of the p-value
    - the probability that the null hypothesis is true **(FALSE)**
    - the probability that the alternative hypothesis is NOT true **(FALSE)** 
    - smaller p-values mean bigger effects **(FALSE)**
    
## Confidence intervals

A _statistic_ calculated from a sample is just an estimate of some population _parameter_. For example, mean height calculated from a sample of 30 UVA male undergraduate students is an estimate of the population mean height. Different samples will almost certainly yield different estimates. A _confidence interval_ gives us some idea of how uncertain we are about an estimate. It provides a lower and upper bound for our estimate. Traditionally we calculate 95% confidence intervals. 

Confidence intervals are _not probability intervals_. 

The "confidence" is in the theoretical process:

1. take a sample from a population
2. calculate a 95% confidence interval for a statistic of interest
3. repeat steps 1 and 2 many times.
4. about 95% of the confidence intervals will contain the "true" value we're 
   trying to estimate

Quick demonstration using simulation: 

1. sample 30 obs from a Normal distribution with mean 175 and SD 10
2. calculate the 95% confidence interval for the sample mean
3. repeat 1000 times
4. determine proportion of times the CI captures the true value.

```{r}
# sample 30 obs from a Normal distribution with mean 175 and SD 10
x <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 175, sd = 10)
# use t.test function to get 95% CI and save
t.out <- t.test(x)
# extract CI and see if it contains the true mean of 175
t.out$conf.int[1] < 175 & t.out$conf.int[2] > 175
```

We can do this 1000 times with the `replicate` function and save the results. We use `{}` to capture more than one line of code. 

```{r}
results <- replicate(1000, expr = {
  x <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 25, sd = 3)
  t.out <- t.test(x)
  t.out$conf.int[1] < 25 & t.out$conf.int[2] > 25})

# mean of TRUE/FALSE (1,0) is proportion of TRUEs
mean(results)
```

The point is that 95% confidence intervals either do or do not contain the "true" value. The _process_ results in CIs capturing the _"true"_ value about 95% of the time.

## CI Example

The article reports a significant difference in mean APACHE II scores between survivors and non-survivors (Table 1). However it does not report a confidence interval on the difference in means. We can obtain this using the `t.test` function. The expression `APA_II_CRRT_0h ~ Death_90D` can be read as "compare the mean APA_II_CRRT_0h score between Death_90D groups".

```{r}
t.test(APA_II_CRRT_0h ~ Death_90D, data = d)
```

Notice the confidence interval is (-4.3, -2.2). We're pretty confident the mean difference is somewhere in that range. 

Note: The internet tells us that "The APACHE II score ranges from 0 to 71 points; however, it is rare for any patient to accumulate more than 55 points." 
## Let's code: confidence interval

The article also reports a significant difference in mean SOFA scores between survivors and non-survivors (Table 1) using a t-test. Let's reproduce the result and get a 95% confidence interval

```{r}

```

Note: The internet tells us that "The SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24 points."

## Linear Model basics

Linear models, or multiple regression, allow us to estimate means _conditional on one or more predictors_. 

For example, Table 1 tells us the overall mean APACHE II score is 27.2

But the _conditional mean_ APACHE II scores given survivor status is

survivors: 25.0
non-survivors: 28.2

We can keep adding conditions.

_Conditional mean_ APACHE II score given survivor status is Non-survivor and age is 50: 27.3

_Conditional mean_ APACHE II score given survivor status is Non-survivor and age is 60: 28.0

Conditioning on a variable may not give appreciably different means. Or put another way, the variable may not be a significant predictor.

T-tests, ANOVAs, and ANCOVAs are all special cases of linear models/multiple regression.

Whole books are devoted to linear regression. This is a very brief intro!

## Linear regression example

From the article: "In a multivariable linear regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex, CCI, MAP, and urine volume, phosphate levels were significantly associated with the SOFA (beta = 0.10, P = 0.02) and APACHE II (beta = 0.58, P < 0.001) scores (Table 2)"

In other words, conditioning on phosphate level appeared to meaningfully change mean APACHE II and SOFA scores, even when they were already conditioning on age, sex, CCI, MAP, and urine volume.

Let's reproduce the SOFA analysis using the `lm` function. The formula for this model is `SOFA_CRRT_0h ~ Age + Sex + CCI + MAP_0h + UO_2hrs + P_0h`. This basically says "we (the authors) think the SOFA score is a weighted sum of age, sex, CCI, MAP, urine volume, and phosphate levels." Or another way to think about it is "we want model the SOFA score as a function of age, sex, CCI, MAP, urine volume, and phosphate levels."

```{r}
m1 <- lm(SOFA_CRRT_0h ~ Age + Sex + CCI + MAP_0h + UO_2hrs + P_0h, data = d)
summary(m1)
```

The Estimates column in the Coefficients section are the "betas". They are the weighted sums in an additive formula. These values match what are in Table 2 (the multivariate column for the SOFA section).

The `P_0H` coefficient (or beta) is 0.10. That says "each additional unit of Phosphate produces an increase of 0.10 in the SOFA mean score, assuming all else held constant." Note: The SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24 and are whole numbers.

Let's say we have two subjects with following values. Notice they are identical except for Phosphate (P_0h).

```{r}
sub1 <- data.frame(Age = 50, Sex = "Female", CCI = 3, 
          MAP_0h = 77, UO_2hrs = 30, P_0h = 4)
sub2 <- data.frame(Age = 50, Sex = "Female", CCI = 3, 
          MAP_0h = 77, UO_2hrs = 30, P_0h = 5)
```

We can use the `predict` function to get expected mean values for our subjects using our model. 

The expected mean SOFA score for subject 1:

```{r}
predict(m1, newdata = sub1)
```

Expected mean SOFA score for subject 2:

```{r}
predict(m1, newdata = sub2)
```

The difference between the expected means is the same as the Phosphate coefficient (0.103703):

```{r}
predict(m1, newdata = sub2) - predict(m1, newdata = sub1)
```

The p-value of 0.02 associated with the Phosphate coefficient is for the null hypothesis test that the coefficient is equal to 0. We have evidence that Phosphate seems to have a _small effect_ on the SOFA score. 

The predictions are subject to uncertainty. We can get a confidence interval by specifying `interval = "confidence"`. This is the expected mean SOFA score for subjects with these specified values.

```{r}
predict(m1, newdata = sub1, interval = "confidence")
```

The Adjusted R-squared is 0.06595. R-squared ranges from 0 to 1 and gives us some indication of the amount of variability our model explains. This says our linear regression model explains about 7% of the variability in the SOFA score. Not great.

One way to check the fit of our model is to plot residuals versus fitted values. In this case residuals are the differences in the _observed_ SOFA score and what the model _predicts_. We can do that by calling `plot` on our model object and specifying `which = 1`. There are 6 different diagnostic plots available and we want the first one.

```{r}
plot(m1, which = 1)
```

The plot shows us...

- most predicted values are between 10 and 14.
- The amount the model is off in either direction is fairly constant, about -10 to 10. (the constant variance is good)
- points above 0 are those observations for which the model under-predicts (the SOFA values are _higher_ than the model predicts)
- points below 0 are those observations for which the model over-predicts (the SOFA values are _lower_ than the model predicts)

Recall SOFA scores range from 0 to 24. A model with conditional means that are systematically "off" by 5 or 10 points is perhaps not great.

## Let's code: linear modeling

Let's reproduce the linear regression of APACHE II scores on Age, Sex, CCI, MAP_0h, UO_2hrs and P_0h, also featured in Table 2.

```{r}

```



## Odds and Odds Ratios

Odds ratios are frequently used in medical research. They often arise in the context of logistic regression, which is used to model the probability of an event given one or more predictors.

Odds are a function of probability.

$$O = \frac{p}{(1 - p)} $$
If p = 0.75, then the odds are 3 to 1.

```{r}
0.75/(1 - 0.75)
```

That's 3 successes for every failure.

If p = 0.25, then the odds are 3 to 1 against, or 1/3.

```{r}
0.25/(1 - 0.25)
```

That's 1 success for every 3 failures.

Notice odds are positive and can range from [0, infinity) unlike probability which ranges [0,1].

**Odds ratios** are simply the ratio of two odds.


## Odds ratio example

Earlier we compared the proportions of survivors and non-survivors with myocardial infarction (MI). Recall the proportions were 0.11 versus 0.09. That's a difference of 0.02. That's sometimes called _risk difference_. We could also compare their odds using odds ratios.

```{r}
tab <- xtabs(~ Death_90D + MI, data = d) %>% 
  proportions(margin = 1)
tab
```

Let's get the odds using the odds formula.

```{r}
surv_odds <- tab[1,2]/(1 - tab[1,2])
death_odds <- tab[2,2]/(1 - tab[2,2])
round(c(death_odds, surv_odds), 2)
```

The odds of dying given you had MI are 0.10. The odds of surviving given you had MI are 0.13.

Let's calculate the _odds ratio_:

```{r}
death_odds/surv_odds
```

It appears the odds of dying within 90 days after CRRT is about (1 - 0.81)*100 = 19% lower for those who experienced myocardial infarction versus those who did not! But this is just a point estimate. We should calculate a confidence interval for the odds ratio. There are many ways to go about doing this. The most common way is in the context of _logistic regression_.


## Logistic regression

Logistic regression is like linear regression but for binary variables (0/1, T/F, succeed/fail, live/die, etc). Instead of predicting conditional means, it _predicts conditional probabilities_ of events.

For example, some subjects died within 90 days of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) initiation, but others did not. Logistic regression could be used to model the _probability of dying_ before 90 days as a function of phosphate levels, age, sex, and other predictors. 

Whole books are devoted to logistic regression. This is a very brief intro!

## Logistic regression example

Earlier we estimated the odds of dying within 90 days after CRRT is about 19% lower for those who experienced myocardial infarction versus those who did not. We can get this same estimate using logistic regression.

We use the `glm` function, which stands for "generalized linear model". We specify `family = binomial` since our response variable is binary. The summary output looks similar to linear regression output, but the coefficients are on the _logit_ scale, or log odds. 

```{r}
lr1 <- glm(Death_90D ~ MI, data = d, family = binomial)
summary(lr1)
```

If we exponentiate the coefficients we get odds ratios. Notice we get the odds ratio calculated by hand above.

```{r}
exp(coef(lr1))
```

And if we use the `confint` function we can get a confidence interval for the odds ratio.

```{r}
exp(confint(lr1))

```

The CI is (0.54, 1.25). The CI on the MI odds ratio overlaps 1 by a wide margin in both directions. (Recall a ratio of 1 is the same as equal odds.) We're not sure what effect having a MI has on the probability of dying within 90 days after CRRT. 

The Intercept is the log-odds of dying without MI. The MI coefficient is the change in log-odds of dying if one had MI.

To get predicted probabilities of dying, use `predict` with `type="response"`.

```{r}
predict(lr1, newdata = data.frame(MI = 0:1), type = "response") %>% 
  round(2)
```

## Let's code: logistic regression

Let's use logistic regression to model the probability of dying within 90 days by hypertension (`HTN`).

```{r}

```



## Odds ratios obscure differences in probabilities

A drawback of odds ratios is that they obscure the difference in probabilities.

Here's an odds ratio of about 9 that reflects an increase from 0.001 to 0.009. 

```{r}
(0.009/(1 - 0.009)) /
  (0.001/(1 - 0.001))
```

Here's another odds ratio of about 9 that reflects an increase from 0.07 to 0.40.

```{r}
(0.4/(1 - 0.4)) /
  (0.07/(1 - 0.07))

```

_An odds ratio of 9 by itself doesn't tell us about absolute risk_. Increasing the risk of illness from 0.001 to 0.009 may not be as concerning as increasing the risk of illness from 0.07 to 0.40.

Carefully consider all statistics. 


## Survival analysis basics

Survival analysis is the analysis of data on _the time until occurrence of a specific event_. Example: time to death within 90 days of CRRT initiation. 

The term "survival" is used because the event of interest is often (sadly) death. Survival analysis is a field unto itself. I can't do it justice in this little presentation!

We use survival analysis to estimate _the probability that a subject does not experience an event until some time_. Example: Probability a subject survives at least 60 days after CRRT initiation.

An important feature of survival analysis data is that it usually contains "incomplete" or _censored_ data. These are subjects that _do not_ experience the event of interest. Example: some subjects (thankfully) survive beyond 90 days after CRRT. However we can make use of their data. To exclude them would _bias_ our probability estimates, which is a fancy way of saying it would make our estimates wrong. 

Two things often done with survival analysis:

1. Estimated survival curves using the _Kaplan-Meier method_. A survival curve plots probability of surviving over time.  
2. Model survival time using _Cox proportional hazards model_. The Cox proportional hazards model is like linear regression for survival time. It's called _proportional_ because it assumes the hazard ratio, or risk of death, between two subjects is the _same over time_.

## Survival analysis example: Kaplan-Meier

From the article: "A Kaplan-Meier curve also confirmed that time to death was significantly shorter in patients with increased phosphate levels (Fig 3)."

Figure 3 shows survival curves for 3 groups:

- Group 1 (phosphate decrease group), less than -1.3 mg/dL
- Group 2 (stable group), -1.3 to 0 mg/dL
- Group 3 (phosphate increase group), greater than 0 mg/dL

These groups are not in the data as a variable and must be _derived_ using the `Delta_P` variable (phosphate change). We can do that using the base R `cut` function. Below we create a new categorical variable called `p_change` that has three groups according to the definition above. 
 
The `breaks = c(-Inf, -1.3, 0, Inf)` argument specifies the boundaries of our groups. `-Inf` and `Inf` are R keywords that mean negative infinity and positive infinity, respectively. Four boundaries implies three groups (right inclusive):

- (-Inf, -1.3]
- (-1.3, 0]
- (0, Inf)
 
```{r}
d <- mutate(d, p_change = cut(Delta_P, 
                              breaks = c(-Inf, -1.3, 0, Inf), 
                              labels = c("Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3")))
xtabs(~ p_change, data = d, subset = Death_90D == "Yes")
```

These counts match those found in the 90-day mortality row in Table 4.

Now we can create the Kaplan-Meier survivor curves for the three groups as presented in Figure 3. This plots the _estimated probability of surviving over time_. To do this we'll use the `survfit` function that's part of the survival package that comes with R.

The `survfit` function creates survival curves using model notation similar to `lm` and `glm`. In this case we want to model `time_to_death_90D` as a function of `p_change`, the grouping variable we just created. The only difference is we need to create a _survival object_ for our response variable using the `Surv` function. It takes two arguments: 

1. the variable we're modeling (`time_to_death_90D`) and,
2. the condition that defines the event of interest (`Death_90D=="Yes"`).

```{r}
library(survival)
surv.group <- survfit(Surv(time_to_death_90D, Death_90D=="Yes") ~ p_change,
                      data = d)
surv.group
```

The median time to death for Group 3 (phosphate increase) was 2 days with a 95% CI of (1.6, 3.0).

Now we can create the plot by calling `plot` on the surv.group object we created. Note: we need to run the entire chunk of code.

```{r}
plot(surv.group, lty = 1:3, xlab = "Days", ylab = "Proportion survival")
legend("topright",c("Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"), lty = 1:3) 

```

To create a ggplot version you can use the survminer package.

```{r}
# install.packages("survminer")
library(survminer)
ggsurvplot(surv.group) +
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Proportion survival")

```


The Phosphate increase group (Group 3) has about a 30% chance of survival to 20 days.

Is there a difference in the survival curves? We can use the _log-rank test_ to assess this by way of the `survdiff` function. The null hypothesis is no difference in survival curves. A small p-value provides evidence against the null hypothesis.

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(time_to_death_90D, Death_90D=="Yes") ~ p_change,
         data = d)
```

The p-value is reported as 1e-04, or 0.0001. We have good evidence the survival curves are indeed different.

Figure 3 in the paper shows _pairwise comparisons_ between the curves. The results can be reproduced by simply subsetting data to compare two groups at a time. For example, Group 1 versus Group 3:

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(time_to_death_90D, Death_90D=="Yes") ~ p_change,
         data = d, subset = p_change != "Group 2")
```


## Let's code: survival analysis.

Let's reproduce Figure 3A, the 28 Day survival curves.

```{r}

```


## Survival analysis example: Cox proportional hazards model

The paper states "To delineate the association between phosphate and mortality, we constructed stepwise multivariable Cox models. In all three models, phosphate levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of death. The fully adjusted model (model 3) revealed that the HR for 90-day mortality was 1.05 (per 1 mg/dL increase, 95% CI, 1.02–1.08; P = 0.001) (Table 3)."

_Stepwise_ is a form of variable selection that automatically finds the "best" model given lots of candidate predictors. It is frowned upon by many statisticians for many reasons.

HR means _hazard ratio_. A hazard ratio measures how often an event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time. A hazard ratio of 1.05 suggests that every one unit increase in phosphate level is associated with 5% increase in the risk of death. 

_The fully adjusted model_, or Model 3, includes phosphate level, age, sex, BMI at ICU admission, CCI, SOFA score, and urine output. (Model 1 just included phosphate; Model 2 included phosphate, age, sex and BMI.) 

Let's reproduce this analysis and compare to Table 3. To do this we use the `coxph` function, also in the survival package. And again we need to use the `Surv` function to define our dependent variable.

```{r}
coxm <- coxph(Surv(time_to_death_90D, Death_90D=="Yes") ~ P_0h + 
                Age + Sex + BMI_ICU + 
                CCI + SOFA_CRRT_0h + UO_2hrs, 
              data = d)
summary(coxm)

```

The second section contains the hazard ratios and their confidence intervals. Notice we get 1.06 (1.03, 1.09) which is slightly different from what the article reported. To reproduce their results exactly, we need to set `ties = "breslow"` in the `coxph` function, which specifies a particular method for handling ties in death times. R uses the "efron" approximation by default.

The _Concordance_ is reported as 0.635. Concordance is a measure of goodness-of-fit for the Cox model. It measures the probability that a prediction goes in the same direction as the actual data. It ranges from 0 to 1. Values less than 0.55 are not great.


## Let's code: Cox proportional hazards model

Let's reproduce model 1 of 28 day mortality as reported in Table 3.

```{r}

```

We're done! That's enough stats!



## Appendix

Material we probably won't get to and is frankly over-and-above what is reasonable to cover in a 2-hour class on "statistics methods".

## Testing the proportional hazards assumption

We can test the proportional hazards assumption with the `cox.zph` function. If the proportional hazards assumption holds, p-values will be high (greater than 0.05, say). If the proportional hazards assumption is violated, that's usually an indication we have an effect that varies _over time_.

```{r}
cox.zph(coxm)
```

It appears CCI and SOFA violate the proportional hazards assumption. The article states "Violation of the proportional hazards assumption was tested by means of _inspection_ of log (-log [survival]) curves." They don't tells us the results of their inspection. Presumably their inspection found nothing to make them second-guess the PH assumption.

We can get similar plots with a `cox.zph` object. Save the result and call `plot` on it. Specify which variable to see with the `var` argument. If the proportional hazards assumption holds then the smooth trend line should be horizontal. The plots for CCI and SOFA actually don't look too bad.


```{r}
ph <- cox.zph(coxm)
plot(ph, var = "CCI")
plot(ph, var = "SOFA_CRRT_0h")
```
